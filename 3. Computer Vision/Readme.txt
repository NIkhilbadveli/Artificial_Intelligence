In this folder, I'll try to cover computer vision related concepts through projects. Here's an overview:

Project ideas:-
- Object detection using YOLO
- Some video analysis idea
- Neural Style Transfer
- Facial recognition

For each of the projects, accuracy should be clearly calculated and a way to improve or reasoning for that accuracy.
