Here I'll try to cover the basics of reinforcement learning.

Some project ideas include:
- Pong from pixels by Andrej Karpathy
- OpenAI Gym
- Weather forecasting
- AlphaFold
- AlphaGo or chess playing bot
- Embodied AI and simulation of evolution in different environments (close to real life), maybe in an open world game
