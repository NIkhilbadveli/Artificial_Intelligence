In this folder, I'll try to cover all the basic machine learning concepts and models. Here's an overview:

Pre-requisites:-
- Statistics
- Probability

Models:-
- Supervised vs Unsupervised learning
- Regression models (Linear & Logistic)
- Classification models
- Clustering models

Project ideas:-
- Some 2 prediction problems (predict land value based on factors - urban, rural, 
	surrounding land recent sale value, agricultural or residential)
- Some classification problem
- Some recommender system

For each of the projects, accuracy should be clearly calculated and a way to improve or reasoning for that accuracy.
