In this folder, I'll try to cover NLP related concepts through projects. Here's an overview:

Project ideas:-
- BERT? Transformer? Word Embeddings?
- Speech recognition or Text to speech
- Machine Translation or Cover letter generator. Maybe use GPT-3 here.
- Chatbots with a personality
- Tweets sentiment analysis for Indian stocks

For each of the projects, accuracy should be clearly calculated and a way to improve or reasoning for that accuracy.
