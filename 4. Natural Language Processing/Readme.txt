In this folder, I'll try to cover NLP related concepts through projects. Here's an overview:

Project ideas:-
- Something related to audio (NLU, NLG)
- Something related to text (NLU, NLG). Maybe use GPT-3 here.
- Some sentimental analysis or chatbot or Netflix subtitle generation based on audio

For each of the projects, accuracy should be clearly calculated and a way to improve or reasoning for that accuracy.
