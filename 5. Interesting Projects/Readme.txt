Project ideas (Primarily replicating other people's work):-
- Image captioning using CNN as encoder and RNN as decoder
- Stock market and social media
- Something that doesn't need large amounts of data - few shot learning
- Generate manga or anime or some story
- Turing's child machine
- SQL query generator or Business/Data Analysis automation

For each of the projects, accuracy should be clearly calculated and a way to improve or reasoning for that accuracy.
