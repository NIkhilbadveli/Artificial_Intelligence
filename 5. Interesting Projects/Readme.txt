Project ideas:-
- AlphaFold
- AlphaGo or chess playing bot
- Embodied AI and simulation of evolution in different environments (close to real life), maybe in an open world game
- Stock market and social media
- Something that doesn't need large amounts of data
- Generate manga or anime or some story
- learning machine
- SQL query generator or Business/Data Analysis automation

For each of the projects, accuracy should be clearly calculated and a way to improve or reasoning for that accuracy.
