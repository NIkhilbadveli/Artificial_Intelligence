In this folder, I'll try to cover deep learning related concepts through projects. Here's an overview:

Concepts:-
- Basic idea of Neural networks
- RNN, CNN, GAN
- LSTM

Project ideas:-
- Some project where RNN is best
- Some project where CNN is best
- Some project where GAN is best (fake faces or art generator)
- Some project where LSTM is best

For each of the projects, accuracy should be clearly calculated and a way to improve or reasoning for that accuracy.
